            <p class="message">Hi Nat, I am really bored right now so I am writing you a virtual letter *NOW I CODED YOU THIS WEBSITE CAUSE APPARENTLY VIRTUAL LETTERS COST MONEY SO ENJOY THIS LITTLE PROJECT :)*, and that always helps me think about my life. I can't write you any more real letters because i dont think there is enough time. Anyway, as of rn im taking a break from the grind. It is hard and very discouraging to find a job, idek what i wanna do anymore. Anyway I finished full metal alchemist so job searching will be my new past time. It is raining and it is times like this where i wish u were here. We probably would be cuddling in bed or maybe baking. I realized rn that nat and nala both start with "n". my two favorite girls be "n" thats so funny and dandy. i think im so in love with you its not even funny sometimes. i feel like i just wanna talk to you forever or stare at you forever. im definitely head over heels for you and i cant stop falling for u more and more everyday. the things you do for me and the way you make me feel secure and how i feel like i can truly be myself around you and how much i know you love me too, they make me feel so special. and i wanna make you feel the same way. i promise to keep trying my best for you no matter how long we are together, because i want to hold on to this feeling we have forever. *wow quick edit while coding this website i realize i can write to you so much here compared to actual handwriting. hm do i have anything else to say, i really miss eating with you. i really should get back to applying to jobs but when i am writing this it is like i am talking to you so i think i will just keep doing this. man i cant wait to just do stuff with you again, i really enjoy your company. also maybe ill use this site for other occasions too. okay im done. I LOVE YOU. btw everything between asterisks are new edits to the og letter if u didnt catch that.* i love you.
