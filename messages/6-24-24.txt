dear nat, i just finished taking nala on a walk and watching inside out 2 with trevor. honestly the movie gave me a lot of insight on myself LOL. im sitting outside on my lawn chair listening to music now, and am thinking about you. i was thinking about how i was really sad when you first left to paris and how i would walk a lot at night and just think, but now i honestly feel more excitement for our future instead of sadness (iâ€™m still sad tho that ur not here). i think after you being in paris, it made me feel like this relationship can go through anything, and i have a secure feeling with you now, knowing that eventually we will end up together. we still dont know when that will be, but i believe in us to do so. miss you so much tho, i cant wait for us to be back together ;) i love you
